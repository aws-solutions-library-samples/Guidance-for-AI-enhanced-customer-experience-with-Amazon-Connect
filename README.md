# Amazon Connect SMB Starter Kit


## Introduction
This document provides an implementation guide for deploying a customer service contact centre solution powered by Amazon Connect and enhanced with Amazon Q's AI capabilities.   By following this guide, you will deploy a fully functional, customer experience solution that enables voice, chat, and messaging interactions. 

This AWS SMB starter kit includes a CloudFormation template that simplifies the deployment process and demonstrates how Amazon Connect leverages generative AI to provide customer self-service capabilities. The solution is particularly valuable for small and medium-sized businesses seeking to implement enterprise-grade, AI-enhanced customer service capabilities with minimal configuration requirements.


 
## Architecture overview
The architecture for this Amazon Connect solution consists of the following key components: 
1.	[Amazon Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/connect-feature-overview.html) - The core service providing Contact Centre capabilities to interact with customers
2.	[Amazon Q in Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-q-connect.html) - The core service providing the generative AI capabilities to answer questions based on the enterprise data
3.	[Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) – Storage capability to house documentation accessed by Amazon Q and host a static webpage.
4.	[CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) – A Content Distribution Network capability to present customer facing website.

NOTE: The solution is designed to be deployed in regions where Amazon Connect and Amazon Q services are available. Please verify service availability in your preferred region before deployment. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/regions.html

## Customer Journey
1. User navigates to a webpage hosted on Amazon S3 and distributed via AWS CloudFront. 
2. End-User or Customer interacts using a chat widget on the webpage.
3. When users interact with the chat widget, a Contact Flow is triggered which invokes the use of Amazon Q in Connect and Lex.
4. Amazon Q in Connect proactively engages with the customer during the interaction using the integrated knowledge base and to provide real-time responses
5. If the customer requests to speak with a human agent, the users have a click to call button for a seamless transfer to an available agent.


## Cost
This bundle uses the following resources:


### Amazon Connect
Amazon Connect pricing includes per minute charging for in-app and web calling and per minute charging for inbound voice usage.

Example: If you handle 1,000 minutes of web calls and from within the United States per month, your costs would include; per-minute web-calling charges of $0.010, and inbound voice usage of $0.018.  [Detailed pricing varies by region](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/pricing/).

*Prices shown here are an estimate calculated on 13th May 2025 for AWS us-east-1 Region. Please check the Amazon Connect Pricing Page for additional details.


### Amazon Q in Connect
Amazon Q in Connect for end-customer self-service is billed at $0.0015 per chat message sent or received by Q in Connect. Similarly, it is billed at $0.008 for every voice minute with Q in Connect enabled, with a 10-second minimum billing requirement. If Amazon Q in Connect is used during the self-service portion of a contact, you are billed for the entire duration of the self-service interaction. There is no charge for building or editing self-service experiences in Amazon Connect, however you'll be billed separately for Amazon Lex usage

**Chat Pricing Example:**

An end-customer sends a message to begin a chat through your website. The chat conversation occurs over multiple hours with a self-service assistant enabled with Amazon Q in Connect, since the end-customer stopped responding and then later resumed the chat. During the chat, the customer sent 9 messages and Amazon Q in Connect sent 15 messages.
1.	There is an Amazon Connect Chat charge, based on the total messages sent during the chat. At $0.004 per message * (9 customer messages + 15 self-service assistant messages) = $0.096
2.	There is an Amazon Q in Connect charge applied for each message sent during the chat. At $0.0015 per message * (9 customer messages + 15 self-service assistant messages) = $0.036
3.	There is an Amazon Lex charge applied for each message the customer sends during the chat. At $0.00075 per text request * (9 customer messages) = $0.00675

The total cost for this chat is $0.13875 (plus applicable taxes, fees, and surcharges).


### Amazon S3
Storage costs will be based on the amount of data stored for FAQ documents, chat transcripts, and web assets.

Example: Using Standard Storage in US East, if you store 50 TB of content, you’d pay $0.023 per GB per month. If you created your account in the past 12 months and you’re eligible for the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?p=ft&z=subnav&loc=1&refid=ft_card&all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=categories%23storage), you’d pay $0.00 per month.

Note:  Amazon CloudFront is only used for the purpose of demonstrating the chat and web-calling capability sing a static webpage.  In a production environment, customers will implement this capability into their existing websites.

For instructions on how to upload your own FAQ document, please see the next section, “Change FAQ document.”
    Example questions
    -	What is your return policy?
    -	How do I return an item?

 ![image](images/22.jpeg) 

_Note: Amazon Q is a generative AI-powered assistant that enables users to ask questions in natural language, without needing to match the exact wording found in company documents. If a user's question is related to information available in connected data sources, Amazon Q will understand the intent, identify relevant content, and provide an appropriate answer-even if the question is phrased differently than in the original document. For instance, if a document contains information about "What is your return and exchange policy?" and a customer asks, "I got my package and I want to return it," Amazon Q will recognize the connection and deliver the relevant answer. If the question is unrelated to any available information, Amazon Q will simply respond that it does not have an answer._

6.	At any stage the agent can say “speak to an agent” to be transferred to an agent via chat.
7.	Log the agent into Amazon Connect and set status to ready to accept the chat.

 ![image](images/23.jpeg)
